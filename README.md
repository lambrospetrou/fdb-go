# FDB-Go

FDBGo will be the implementation of FDB - Factorized Databases - in Go lang

## Bibliography

This implementation will mostly use ideas from the original publications:

1) FDB: A Query Engine for Factorised Relational Databases @ http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/dan.olteanu/papers/boz-vldb12

and will extend this (slowly ;p) as I did in my thesis:

2) Lambros Petrou - University of Oxford, Master of Science in Computer Science thesis - [Thesis Repository](https://github.com/lambrospetrou/oxford-msc) - [PDF](https://github.com/lambrospetrou/oxford-msc/blob/master/word/latex-word.pdf)

At the moment target is the main functionality of a factorizations and its serialization. Then, the f-tree functionality (swap, mege, etc.) will come
